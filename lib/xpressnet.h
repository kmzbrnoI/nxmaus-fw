/* XpressNET communication lirary (via UART).
 *
 * Automatic XpressNET device address collision detection & changing relies
 * on running timer0.
 *
 * Before changing uart_output_buf & calling uart_send*, you must check that
 * uart_can_fill_output_buf() is true.
 *
 * This library uses constant adressing timeout 1 s, which is not enough for
 * Command Station in programming mode -> it will call error event
 * uart_on_addressed_stopped 1 s after service mode enter. After resuming to
 * normal mode, library will detect it and call uart_on_addressed.
 *
 * This library allows to sniff data from command station to other XpressNET
 * devices (uart_on_receive) as well as sniffing data sent from other XpressNET
 * devices to the Command Station (uart_on_sniff). If you don't want to use
 * these features, just don't register events.
